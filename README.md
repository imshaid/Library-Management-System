# Learning Management System (LMS)

## Project Overview

The **Learning Management System (LMS)** is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Lab Project developed as part of our coursework.  
This system is designed to manage **users, courses, books, and dashboards** in an efficient way. It applies **core OOP principles** such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, along with exception handling and modular code design.

The LMS provides both **Admin** and **User** functionalities, ensuring role-based access and a smooth workflow.

## Objectives

- To demonstrate **OOP concepts** through a real-world application.
- To design a system that is **scalable, modular, and easy to maintain**.
- To build a **Java-based console/GUI application** for managing learning resources.
- To apply **file handling, exception handling, and utility classes**.

## Features

### User Features

- User Registration and Login
- Browse available books and resources
- Borrow and return books
- View personal dashboard and points

### Admin Features

- Manage Users (Add, Update, Delete, View)
- Manage Books and Book Details
- Dashboard with statistics
- Authentication for Admin login

### General Features

- Exception Handling for robust execution
- File Handling for persistent data
- Chatbot-like intent handler (for learning/assistance)
- MVC-based structure (Model, View, Controller)

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Java
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Framework/Tools:** JavaFX
- **IDE:** VS Code
- **Version Control:** Git

## OOP Concepts Implemented

- **Encapsulation:** Private fields with getters and setters in model classes.
- **Inheritance:** Admin and User classes inherit from a Person superclass.
- **Polymorphism:** Method overriding (e.g., different dashboard behavior for Admin and User).
- **Abstraction:** Abstract classes and interfaces used for defining core behaviors.
- **Exception Handling:** Input validation and safe runtime error handling.

## Contributors & Roles

- **Md. Shaid Hasan** – 241-15-360  
  Prepared the project report, UML diagram, and JSON data for database initialization, and contributed to overall documentation, integration, and unassigned tasks such as testing support.

- **Contributor 2** – 241-15-364  
  Implemented the Java model classes such as Book, User, Admin, and BorrowedBook, ensuring proper encapsulation and inheritance.

- **Contributor 3** – 241-15-505  
  Developed the utility classes and helper functions, supporting core operations like validation, formatting, and file handling.

- **Contributor 4** – 241-15-851  
  Worked on the controller layer for the Admin panel, managing backend logic for administrative tasks such as book management and user control.

- **Contributor 5** – 241-15-977  
  Implemented the controller layer for the Student panel, handling user interactions like book search, borrowing, and profile management.
